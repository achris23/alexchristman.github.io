            <p1 class = "col-12">Travelling is one of my favorite things to do! Over the years I have been to a number of places that I have really enjoyed. If I was to rate the top five places I have been to the list would include Costa Rica, San Francisco, Cancun, Charleston South Carolina, and Savannah Georiga. </p1>

            <h2> Costa Rica</h2>
            <p> Costa Rica is an amazingly cool place! While I was there I stayed in the Nicoya peninsula and around the Arenal volcano.</p>

            <div class="sanfran">
            <h2>San Francisco</h2>
            <p>I visited San Francisco about five years ago and had an amazing time. I got to see the Golden Gate bridge and Alcatraz Island!</p>

            <div class="cancun">
            <h2>Cancun</h2>
            <p>Cancun is a really great place to visit. I had always wanted to go to a beach with clear blue water and Cancun did not disappoint. </p>

            <div class="charls">
            <h2> Charleston South Carolina</h2>
            <p>My oldest sister, Shannon, lives in Charleston so its a place I visit quite often. Charleston is an old city with some amazing history. My favorite things about Charleston are the architecture of the buildings and their amazing food.</p>

            <div class= "sav">
            <h2> Savannah Georgia</h2>
            <p>Savannah is only a couple hours away from Charleston and its another city I really love because of its history. One of my favorite parts about Savannah are all the parks located throughout the city. Just about every other block has a small park right next to it.</p>
