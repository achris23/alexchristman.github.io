          <p>The future use to be something that always made me uncomfortable and nervous to think about. However, lately I have become very excited about what my future holds and I dont mind thinking about it so much. I will graduate from Kent State in May of 2018 with a degree in Digital Science and I can't wait! Graduating from college has always been a goal of mine and im very happy that I will finally be reaching it. My next major life goals will be to obtain a career in the I.T. field and buy a house.</p>
